This repository contains a `copier` template for battery modeling projects using PyBaMM, released under the [BSD-3-Clause license](https://github.com/pybamm-team/pybamm-cookiecutter/blob/main/LICENSE). Currently under active development.

## üìÑ Using `pybamm-cookiecutter`

### Generating projects with `pybamm-cookiecutter`

#### Manually using copier

Install `copier` and `jinja2_time` extension using `pip`.
```bash
pip install copier jinja2-time
```
Generate a project from the `pybamm-cookiecutter` template.

```bash
copier copy https://github.com/pybamm-team/pybamm-cookiecutter.git . --trust
# this will generate the project in the current working directory
copier copy https://github.com/pybamm-team/pybamm-cookiecutter.git path_to_copy_to/ --trust
# this will generate the project in the specified path
```
#### Using pipx (recommended)

You can generate a project by executing the `pipx run` command which doesn't need any package installations.
```bash
pipx run pybamm-cookiecutter --path /path_to_copy_to
```

Or if you wish to install the `pybamm-cookiecutter` package and then generate a project, you could do so with the help of following commands.
```bash
pipx install pybamm-cookiecutter  # or pip install pybamm-cookiecutter
```
Navigate into the directory you want your project directory to reside in, or use `--path` argument to explicitly mention the path where you want your project to be generated.
```bash
pybamm-cookiecutter --path /path_to_copy_to
```

Copier will prompt you with various configurations and you may choose the ones that suit your use case.

**Note**: A `git` repository is automatically initialised when a project is created within a directory.

After generation, you can navigate to the generated project and run `nox -s generated-project-tests` to ensure if the project units are working as intended.

### Installing the `pybamm-cookiecutter` project

This refers to the project used for the development of this template. There are two ways to install this project: either through `nox` or `pip`. `nox` uses `uv pip` or `pip` internally, and in this case, creates a virtual environment for you to activate.
To install, navigate to the root directory of this repository and execute either of these commands:

`nox -s dev`
or
`pip install -e .[dev]`

To check if the project was successfully installed, import the project inside Python.

```python
import pybamm_cookiecutter

pybamm_cookiecutter.__version__
```
