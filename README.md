This repository contains a `cookiecutter` template for battery modeling projects using PyBaMM, released under the [BSD-3-Clause license](https://github.com/pybamm-team/pybamm-cookiecutter/blob/main/LICENSE). Currently under active development.

## üìÑ Using `pybamm-cookiecutter`

### Generating projects with `pybamm-cookiecutter`

This template is not on PyPI yet, so it cannot be installed through `pip` until the first release. Meanwhile, it can be used by cloning this repository and using `cookiecutter` to generate a project with this template.

To use pybamm-cookiecutter template, first clone this repository on your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pybamm-team/pybamm-cookiecutter.git
```
Create a temporary virtual environment inside the reposiory and activate it.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install cookiecutter and generate the project using the pybamm-cookiecutter template by moving outside the parent pybamm-cookiecutter directory.
```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter pybamm-cookiecutter/
```

Cookiecutter will prompt you with various configurations and you may choose the ones that suit your use case.

**Note**: If you created a repository using this template within GitHub and cloned it locally, you can skip the next step.

Once the project is generated through cookiecutter, initialise `git` by executing `git init` inside your project directory.


### Installing the `pybamm-cookiecutter` project

This is our version of the project generated using the cookiecutter template. There are two ways to install this project, either through `nox` or `pip`. `nox` uses `uv pip` or `pip` internally, and in this case creates a virtual environment for you to activate.
To install, navigate to the root directory of this repository and execute either of these commands:

`nox -s dev`
or
`pip install -e .[dev]`

To check if the project was successfully installed, import the project inside Python.

```python
import pybamm_cookiecutter

pybamm_cookiecutter._version.version
```
