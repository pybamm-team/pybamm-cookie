# PyBaMM ships with many parameter sets for a variety of chemistries, such as
# lead-acid and lithium-ion parameter sets. For more information plus details
# on how to create your own parameter sets, refer to the PyBaMM documentation
# on parameter sets at
# https://docs.pybamm.org/en/latest/source/api/parameters/parameter_sets.html

# The function below is listed for you as an entry point in pyproject.toml so
# that it can be used as a parameter set for experiments using PyBaMM. You may
# add more functions to describe calculations and other functionality.

# Note: the function name must be "get_parameter_values" for PyBaMM to recognise
# it as a parameter set.
